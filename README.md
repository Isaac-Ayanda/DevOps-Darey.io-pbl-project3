# MERN Web Stack Implementation Project


- In this Project I created a simple To-Do and deployed it to MERN stack. 
- I wrote a frontend application using React.js that communicates with a backend application written using Expressjs. 
- I also created a Mongodb backend for storing tasks in a database.
